Using a database management system cloud service was a pretty useful tool since it allows individuals/groups/users to work with huge files using the computational power available on that cloud server without having to rely on one's own computer. It almost evens the playing field so you don't need the highest end computer as long as you can access the service. I know for a fact that my little brother's computer would take ages to run some of these queries we had to write for this homework assignment. However, there are some drawbacks which is the internet. If your internet connection is down or the server shuts down, it's a bummer because you can't work anymore (this happened a couple times for me, where Azure decides to not like my login anymore). And worst case scenario is when running a query and then it has a shutdown. The time it takes to re-query that (especially if it's a massive datafile), would prove annoying.
